# What is Cubby?
Cubby is an interactive learning management system that targets young students (ages 5-7) in remote and hybrid classrooms. Our primary goals were to foster social-emotional learning and facilitate parent-teacher relationships. This solution aims to improve virtual education for students during the pandemic, and beyond.

Our main goal over the course of two semesters was to produce a clickable prototype, landing page, and interactive demo to showcase our work. You can view our process book where we documented our entire development process with final prototype, interactive demo, and landing page that we created, click on the link below and hope you enjoy them as we do :)
